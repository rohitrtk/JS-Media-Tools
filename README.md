# Webp Converter

## How to Install

1. Clone/download the repo and open it in your code editor
2. Run `npm install` in the repo to install node modules
3. Once node modules are installed you can either:
    1. Run `npm run start` in a terminal to run the program
    2. Run `npm run make` to make the application. You can then navigate to `out/make` where there will be a setup executable which you can run to install the application and then run it.

## Usage

Once the application is open, there will 3 buttons. The first of interest is the **Upload Files** button, which once clicked will prompt you to select images in a folder you wish to convert. The second is the **Output Directory** button, which when clicked will
prompt you to select a folder to output the converted webp images to. By default, when you first select your images, the output directory will automatically be set to the directory of those selected images. The third button is the **Convert** button which as its name suggests, converts your images to webp.
